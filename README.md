# Deepfake_Image_Detection
Deepfake image detection is a critical endeavor aimed at combating the proliferation of manipulated visual content. Leveraging advancements in machine learning, our proposed approach offers a robust solution for identifying deepfake images. By employing convolutional neural networks (CNNs), trained on a diverse dataset encompassing both authentic and manipulated images, our method effectively discerns subtle discrepancies indicative of deepfakes. Unlike traditional methods reliant on manual feature extraction, our CNN-based approach autonomously learns discriminative features, resulting in superior accuracy and efficiency. Moreover, its versatility enables application across a broad spectrum of deepfake variations. With heightened precision and adaptability, our approach represents a promising advancement in the ongoing fight against deceptive visual media. By safeguarding against the pernicious impact of deepfake images, it contributes to fostering a more trustworthy digital landscape.
